# Stochastic-Process-and-Random-Walk


Let's start with an simple exmple of a discrete-time ramdom walk in which the length of each step is 1. The walker is initially at an coordinates (0, 0) which is the center of the circle. The stochastic process stops once the walker escape from the circle with redius of 10. 

At each position, the walker can move toward four directions with uniformly distributed probability. Turn left, turn right, move up and move down. The probability of each direction is shown below: 

```
Prob (Left) = 0.3
Prob (Right) = 0.25
Prob (Up) =  0.35
Prob (Down) = 0.1
```
