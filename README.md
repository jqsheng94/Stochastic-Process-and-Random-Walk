# Stochastic-Process-and-Random-Walk

The starting point of the random walk is the center of the circle where original coordinates equal to (0,0) and stops once our object exit the circle with redius of 10. 

At each position, object can move toward four directions with fixed probability. Turn left, turn right, move up and move down. 

```
Prob(Left) = 0.3
Prob(Right) = 0.25
Prob(Up) =  0.35
Prob(Down) = 0.1
```
